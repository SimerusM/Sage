The National Energy Plan aims to install other sources of energy to achieve a diversification of the basket and ensure a reliable energy supply. The inclusion of wind power plants, photovoltaic solar generation, geothermal energy and generation from the biomass in the country's electric mix is ??sought.
The UPME (Unit of Energy Mining Planning - Unidad de Planeación Minero Energética) identified the possible medium and long-term expansion alternatives that would allow the basket to diversify and have evaluated its impact on the system in the Expansion Reference-Generation and Transmission Plan 2014-2028. Several scenarios were presented. One of the scenarios considers the participation of more than 10% in non-conventional renewable energy in installed capacity by 2028, with a generation that ranges from 2.5% to 7.5% of total production in the period of analysis.
In the most feasible scenario, unconventional sources of energy may account for 6% of the electric energy basket, which would correspond to an installed capacity of 1,207 MW in 2028. In addition to the 474 MW of wind power in the pessimistic scenario, it is considered possible to install 143 MW of solar energy, 275 geothermal and 314 MW of biomass cogeneration.

By January of 2013, the mix requirement will increase to 5% (B5),with possibilities for higher blend percentages all the way up to pure biodiesel (B100) by authorization of the Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Regulator (ANP), which is given regulatory and fiscal control, by that same law, over production and sale of biofuels. The National Council of Energy Policy (Conselho Nacional de Politica Energética, CNPE) subsequently introduced a number of resolutions to realize the requirements of Law 11.097. Resolution #2 of March, 2008 set a 3% requirement as of July 2008; Resolution #2 of April, 2009 set a 4% requirement as of July 2009 and Resolution #6 of September, 2009 set a 5% requirement as of January 2010. In May 2014, the Minister of Mines and Energy announced that the biodiesel requirement will increase to 6% on July 1, 2014 and 7% on November 1, 2014.

Main objective of the Algerian Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan is to expand usage of renewable energies and to diversify energy sources in the country.
Goals:
To install 22 000 MW of power generating capacity from renewable sources between 2011 and 2030 (of which 12 000 for internal usage and 10 000 MW for export);
To meet 20% of electricity generation from renewables by 2030
Renewable energy development will drive sustainable economic development of the country, increase energy security supply in Algeria and will have job-creation factor;
Solar energy (both solar PV and solar thermal) is recognized by the Algerian government as a primary renewable technology to be developed. The potential for wind, biomass, geothermal and hydropower energies is comparatively very small.
Combined, Algeria hopes to have more than 22 GW of renewable energy capacity installed by 2030, and has targeted the connection of 4.5 GW by 2020. Should Algeria hit its target, renewable energy would by 2030 account for 27% of the nation’s power outpout, offsetting the need for 22 GW of natural gas generation.

In order to achieve these goals, their action plan is embedded in three key policy frameworks: EU-ETS (aviation and heavy industry), binding targets for non-ETS emissions and LULUCF.
The previous Action Plan stated 48 mitigation plans to address economy-wide emissions. Currently, the Industry sector is the biggest emitter. The actions to mitigate emissions include incentives, tax, ban, investment in renewables, carbon capture and climate fund (Iceland Climate Action Plan, 2020)

In addition to an economy-wide target to continue to achieve a rate of energy intensity improvement of 1.3 percent per annum the Conservation Strategy sets out objectives for six sectors:
Transport: a more energy-efficient transport system, with a greater diversity of fuels and alternative energy technologies
Business: enhanced business growth and competitiveness resulting from energy intensity improvements
Housing: warm, dry and energy-efficient homes with improved air quality to avoid ill-health and lost productivity
Products: greater business and consumer uptake of energy-efficient products

The sectors covered are electricity, transport, building (cooking, lightning). The emissions of the industry sector are negligible. The gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2) methane (CH4) nitrous oxide (N2O).
In the electricity sector, the NDC focuses on investing in electricity grid upgrades to improve grid stability, minimize system losses (currently around 30%) and accommodate more variable generation from renewable energy. The country intends to shift from diesel towards renewables in the next decade. In the building sector, the focus will be on energy efficiency (future building codes, retrofits and best performance of appliances) and replacement of diesel generators as well as tariffs to disincentive consumption. In the transportation sector, policies to encourage public transportation, cycling and walking is the kernel for future actions, nevertheless, identifying policy options for the uptake of electric vehicles is also envisaged.

The new renewable energy law establishes more ambitious national renewable energy targets that should reach 20% of total national energy consumption and 40% of total electricity consumption by 2020. Moreover, 20% of energy used in heating and cooling and 10% of energy used in transportation have to come from renewable sources. The new legislation foresees the creation of a Special Renewable Energy Investment Service that will act as an interface between public institutions and investors, annually assess the main challenges to renewable energy deployment and manage the support funding allocation process. Existing remuneration of individual residents in areas where renewable energy projects are running have been amended and replaced by a credit on electricity bills. In fact, the law establishes that a share of the RE concession taxes paid by RE producers to regional and local authorities will will be allocated to local households as a credit on their electricity bill as a way to share the benefits of living nearby a renewable energy generation plant. The renewable energy generation licensing process has also been very much fasten and eased by the regulation that entitles the Regulatory Authority for Energy (RAE) with the assessment and issuance of licences, under the authority of the ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change. The whole licensing process can not last over a 30-month period. Moreover, absolute priority is given to RES projects combined with desalination plants, when and only when the RES project is on an island and its capacity does not exceed 25% of the capacity of the desalination plant. The law also tackles the grid infrastructure challenge and implements a timely limited target for the grid utility to connect non-interconnected islands to the main grid. Still, RE projects are not granted grid priority access as grid connection will be established on a first-come first served basis until the network is saturated. The grid utility is compelled to provide grid access within four months after the connection demand has been released. The Law 3851 also establishes a whole new set of feed-in tariffs for electricity from renewable sources, to be found in the Greek FIT article.

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

This Strategy identifies key objectives and building blocks that could underlie its transition to a lowGHG economy. These building blocks frame the foundation of Canada’s long term climate change mitigation strategy:
• Electrification. The electrification of end use applications that are currently using fossil fuels.
• Concurrent trends towards decarbonisation of the electricity generating sector are needed.
• The significant increase in electricity demand resulting from electrification policies (e.g., doubling or more by 2050), and electricity exports, should be satisfied through low-carbon sources.
• Canada, and North America’s, electricity future will be shaped by interprovincial and intercontinental cooperation.
• Energy efficiency and demand side management are key to achieving deep GHG reductions.
• Some sectors such as heavy industries, marine transportation, some heavy freight transportation, and aviation could move to lower or low-carbon fuels such as second generation biofuels or hydrogen.
• Abatement of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases, such as methane and hydrofluorocarbons, is a priority.
• Behavioural changes will also contribute to a low-GHG economy.
• Focus on cities.
• Canada’s forests and lands will continue to play an important role in sequestering substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
• The private sector has an important role to play in this respect including spurring investment and innovation towards low GHG alternatives. Carbon pricing will be an important element to achieving this objective.

It covers two five-year periods: 2017-2022 and 2022-2027.
The NEP projects electricity demand and supply planning until the fiscal year 2026/27. It has a cumulative target of 175 GW renewable energy capacity by 2022. The NEP foresees coal-fired power capacity additions of 46 GW between 2022 and 2027.
""It is expected that the share of non-fossil based installed capacity (Nuclear + Hydro + Renewable Sources) will increase to 46.8 % by the end of 2021-22 and will further increase to 56.5 % by the end of 2026-27 considering capacity addition of 50,025 MW coal based capacity already under construction and likely to yield benefits during 2017-
22 and no coal based capacity addition during 2022-27."" (http://www.cea.nic.in/reports/committee/nep/nep_dec.pdf)
It implies that no new coal-fired power plants are necessary beyond those already under construction (Carbon Brief, 2017), and further calls of 57% of electric capacity to be non-fossil by 2027 (Carbon Brief, 2017).
Other targets: Renewable energy generation share of 20% by 2022; Renewable energy generation share of 24% by 2027.
Renewable energy sector is now poised for a quantum jump as India has reset its renewable energy capacity addition target so as to have an installed capacity of 175 GW (100GW solar, 60GW wind, 10GW biomass and 5GW small-hydro) by 2022, in view of the significant renewable energy potential in the country and commitment made by the investors/stakeholders.

However, from these 7%, 5% corresponds to the private sector and 2% from the public sector.
The reference year chosen is 2010 and the BAU measured is 51 milGgCO2.
The country posited 46 Mitigation options in Transport, electricity, industry, agriculture and forestry sector, and also adaptation options. The policy instruments overarch all the sectors and mitigation areas. Special attention to fuel switch and investment in renewables in electricity, transport and industry sectors. Also, codes and standards for a less demand and more material efficiency are the base for the building sector, but also present in electricity and transport. Additionally, biomass is incited as a fuel rather than fossils in the industry and agriculture sector (Dominican Republic NDC, 2020).
The main policy instruments are possible to cite the economic strategic planning (Plan DECCC-2011 and Ley-1-12) and the Climate Change National policy (Decree 269-15 – PNCC 2015). Also, in the transport sector it is planned to set codes and standards to reduce GHG emissions (e.g. resource efficiency area – new lines, new modals, low carbon tech and electric cars). In the electricity sector the efforts are to increase the share of renewables (wind, solar and PCH) and fuel switch to a less intensive. In the building sector, Dominican Republic wants to improve energy efficiency (codes and standards visioning more efficiency) and resource efficiency to reduce the demand of energy, set new standards to introduce efficient lighting for public and residential areas. In addition, in the industry sector standards will be set for the acquisition of industrial electric motors and in biomass to replace fossil fuel.  Reforestation is also envisioned by the country.

The country projects the BAU scenario to reach 310MtCO2 in 2030. The country  aims to reduce 23.5% by 2030, relative to the BAU scenario (UAE NDC, 2020).
The NDC sets for the electricity sector a goal of 50% share of clean energy (renewables and nuclear) in the installed power capacity mix by 2050, since UAE is investing in solar energy and nuclear energy. UAE is on track to reach 14 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A grid-based clean power, distributed electricity generation, rooftop solar photovoltaic in particular, is being promoted in the Emirate of Dubai. As a last strategy, regulatory measures and technology deployment are envisioned to increase efficiency of energy consumption with an end goal to reduce it by 40% by 2050 with periodic tariff reforms.
In the building sector, codes and standards are the main instrument, with green building regulations and rating schemes for new buildings. Standards and labels may enable informed consumer choices, thus UAE has established an Energy Efficiency Standardization and Labelling Program which covers a range of household goods and appliances. The approach for the industry sector is based on voluntary targets of carbon usage reduction and looking at the transport one a fuel pricing reform (international prices for gasoline, quality standards for fuel and motor and stimulation of a sustainable transport (shifting transport modals for a public one or electric cars) are the strategy disclosed.
CAT calculates the new target to be 246MtCO2 and highly insufficient  and emphasises that there is no mention of net-zero target (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

The forest concession in public forests in Brazil started to be legally handled through the ""Law for the Management of Public Forests"". The costly forest concession, through the payment for the sustainable use of forest products and services, is a way of indirect management that can be applied to National Forests and other types of public forests which are not designated to community use or protected areas of ""full protection"" category. Thus allowing federal, state and local governments to grant to private actors the right to sustainably exploit the goods and services present in public forests. It is worth highlighting the fact that this law does not allow the commercialization of carbon credits and other environmental services by the owner of the concession, as explained in art. 16, 1st paragraph of section VI.
The Brazilian government currently implements a concession policy to exploit timber harvesting on national forestry reserves. The law creates a Brazilian Forest Service, sets up a National Forest Development Fund and puts into effect an infrastructure for sustainable use of public lands (including the use of concessions). The law aims to strengthen forest conservation (especially in the
Amazon) by decreasing land speculation, putting an end to fraudulent property claims (grilagem) and creating a socially inclusive, sustainable forest-based economy.

Additionally, it aims to scale up Japanese water electrolysis equipment production to about 15 GW by 2030 globally and attract JPY 15 tn ($107.5 billion) in public and private investments into the sector over the next 15 years.
The roadmap seeks to realize a hydrogen-based society on a step-by-step basis under the following three-phase program, carefully considering both short and long periods of time required to overcome technological challenges and secure economic efficiency:
(i) Phase 1: Dramatic expansion of hydrogen use (from present). By expanding the use of fixed fuel cells and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) dramatically, Japan will capture the global market for hydrogen and fuel cells in which it leads the world.
(ii) Phase 2: Full-fledged introduction of hydrogen power generation and establishment of a large-scale hydrogen supply system (by the second half of the 2020s). While increasing hydrogen demand further, Japan will increase the scope of current hydrogen sources to cover unused energy sources and establish a new secondary energy structure including hydrogen in addition to traditional electricity and heat.
(iii) Phase 3: Establishment of a CO2-free hydrogen supply system on a total basis (by around 2040). Japan will combine hydrogen production with CCS or use hydrogen from renewable energy to establish a totally CO2-free hydrogen supply system.",https://www.env.go.jp/seisaku/list/ondanka_saisei/lowcarbon-h2-sc/PDF/Summary_of_Japan's_Hydrogen_Strategy.pdf

Lack of subsidies and strong pollution laws encourage industries to migrate to cleaner fuel options, and the government facilitates the adoption of energy efficient technologies through grants and other supportive policies. In the transport sector the government is promoting public transportation and greener vehicles (e.g. electric) and for the buildings sector Singapore established codes and standards, such as ‘Super low Energy Buildings Performance’ to develop and achieve a pattern of energy-efficiency.
According to CAT, the new NDC is rated 'Highly insufficient'. The NDC sets an absolute target of 65 MtCO2, which is also outlined as the peak in the country’s emission.

The NDC covers power, transport and industry (which in the NDC covers also the building sector).
In the power sector, the Government has a financing scheme to finance alternative energy generation projects, like small scale solar and micro grids. In the transport sector the government supports switch to lower-emitting modes of transport, implementation of Mass Rapid Transit and Bus Rapid Transit and modern rail networks. Bangladesh sets an unconditional reduction to this sector of 9% below BAU.
In the industry and building sector, Bangladesh aims to achieve a reduction in primary energy consumption per GDP by adopting mitigation through building codes, standards and energy efficiency certifications (e.g. LEED).
Bangladesh has targets to increase renewable energy generation (10%) and lower energy intensity consumption. Also, some CDM projects involve the reduction of natural gas leakage from transmission lines. Lastly, in the AFOLU sector, Bangladesh plans to monitor the coverage of forest embedded in the REDD+ project.

The details of the emission trading scheme (ETS) are not made public yet. The ETS will start with the electricity sector covering around 3.5 Gt CO2 emissions (Stavins, 2017) and is expected to start in 2020 (China Carbon Forum, 2017). After that, gradually other industry sectors, such as cement, steel, petroleum refining and chemicals will be added to the program. The ETS targets is not an absolute emissions gap, but a rate based (CO2/Kwh) cap that is set per category per sector. The rate is based on historical trends and technology benchmarks (Stavins, 2017). For example, coal-fired power plants are expected to have different rates, than gas-fired power plants. In the beginning, the permits of this scheme will be grandfathered to the firms, in this case plants emitting more than 26,000 tonnes of CO2 per year (Carbon Brief, 2017).","https://chinaenergyportal.org/en/national-carbon-emissions-trading-market-establishment-program-power-generation-industry/ http://www.chinacarbon.info/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-China-Carbon-Pricing-Survey.pdf

It also foresees oil as a key supply in its energy mix and for its economic development, and plans to expand hydrocarbon exploration activities as a consequence.
The strategy also seeks to foster the use of renewable energy, primarily through the development of wind and solar energy. The development of renewables aims to reduce the use of fossil fuels by 2.6 Mtoe/year and to create 25,000 jobs by 2030.
The strategy considers the improvement of energy efficiency as a priority, especially in the buildings and transport sector.

The directive aims to support the 2020 Climate and Energy Package target of 20% energy efficiency increase by 2020.
""New national measures have to ensure major energy savings for consumers and industry alike. For example:
- energy distributors or retail energy sales companies have to achieve 1.5% energy savings per year through the implementation of energy efficiency measures
- EU countries can opt to achieve the same level of savings through other means such as improving the efficiency of heating systems, installing double glazed windows or insulating roofs
- the public sector in EU countries should purchase energy efficient buildings, products and services
- every year, EU governments will carry out energy efficient renovations on at least 3% of the buildings they own and occupy by floor area
- empowering energy consumers to better manage consumption. This includes easy and free access to data on consumption through individual metering
- national incentives for SMEs to undergo energy audits
- large companies will make audits of their energy consumption to help them identify ways to reduce it
- monitoring efficiency levels in new energy generation capacities"" (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1399375464230&uri=CELEX:32012L0027)
In 2018, as part of the 'Clean energy for all Europeans package', the amending Directive on Energy Efficiency (2018/2002) was agreed to update the policy framework to 2030 and beyond. Its key element is a headline energy efficiency target for 2030 of at least 32.5%. The target, to be achieved collectively across the EU, is set relative to the 2007 modelling projections for 2030.
In absolute terms, this means that EU energy consumption for 2030 should be no more than 1128 Mtoe (million tonnes of equivalent) of primary energy and/or no more than 846 Mtoe of final energy (following the withdrawal of the UK).
The amending directive also includes an extension to the energy savings obligation in end use, introduced in the 2012 directive. Under the amending directive, EU countries will have to achieve new energy savings of 0.8% each year of final energy consumption for the 2021-2030 period, except Cyprus and Malta that will have to achieve 0.24% each year instead.
The directive entered into force in December 2018 and had to be transposed into national law by Member States by 25 June 2020, except for metering and billing provisions which has a different deadline (25 October 2020).",https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/energy-efficiency/energy-efficiency-targets-directive-and-rules/energy-efficiency-directive_en#content-heading-0

The annual decrease of allowances should be equal to 1,74 % of the allowances issued by Member States pursuant to Commission Decisions on Member States’ national allocation plans for the period from 2008 to 2012, so that the Community scheme contributes cost-effectively to achieving the commitment of the Community to an overall reduction in emissions of at least 20 % by 2020.""

when the indicative cumulative cost of all types of incentives awarded to RES-E plants (other than photovoltaic ones) reaches an overall value of € 5.8 billion per year.
The Decree defines three different ways of access to the incentives, depending on plant capacity and type of project (art. 4):
 1. Direct access for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants with a capacity not exceeding a given limit (art. 4, paragraph 3) and using specific types of sources or for special projects;
2. Enrolment into the Registries for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded and renovated plants
3. Awarding of incentives after participation in a competitive Dutch auctions (electronic auctions held by GSE) for new, totally rebuilt, reactivated or repowered/upgraded plants: the capacity of these plants shall exceed a given threshold (5 MW).
To determine the way of access to the incentives for renovated plants, the capacity to be considered corresponds to the increase in capacity obtained as a result of the project.
The total maximum new installed capacity that could be awarded to all technologies through both registries and auctions is 1.370 MW of which 800 MW for new onshore wind capacity.
Between the communication of the registration and the entry into operation the maximum time gap limit depends of the plant technology.

It is an absolute target using 2005 as reference year.  Brazil proposes a target to reduce by 37% by 2025 and by 43% by 2030 relative to 2005 levels. Nevertheless, it does not translate in absolute numbers, referring to Brazil’s Third National Communication of the country to see the emissions level in the base year.
Regarding long-term strategy, from 2021 onwards Brazil states it requires US$ 10 billion per year to realize environmental pledges, including conservation of native vegetation and states that the function of market mechanisms is paramount to achieve carbon neutrality earlier than 2060.
According to CAT, the Brazilian updated NDC is weaker than the previous one, being rated 'Highly insufficient"". The CAT shows that an increase in the emissions used as reference data allows Brazil to increase its emissions over than 400 MtCO2e still meeting the relative proposed target (1,453 MtCO2e in 2025 and 1,307 in 2030).
Another rollback is the removal of explicit sectoral mitigation targets, especially those related to halt illegal deforestation in the Amazon.","https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Brazil%20First/Brazil%20First%20NDC%20(Updated%20submission).pdf

211003491,An Integrated Climate and Energy Policy Sweden (2009),Sweden,"Climate strategy, Formal & legally binding climate strategy",General,"Legislative
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy specifies targets for reducing GHG emissions and provides a joint action plan to achieve emission reductions. The climate tax package changes to different taxes and subsidies (2MtCO2e by 2020) to balance future increases in energy and environmental taxes for enterprises and households against equivalent tax concessions, allows for a tax exemption for green cars (emissions of less than 120g of CO2/km) from vehicle tax. Furthermore the bill contains a carbon tax, which increases for heating in industry outside the scope of EU ETS such as agriculture, forestry and aquaculture (30% in 2011, 60% in 2015) and reduces the carbon tax rebate for diesel. It also facilitates green investments in developing countries, climate policy and development co-operation and an increased focus on climate change adaptation (responsibility to co-ordinate climate adaptation is given to country administrative boards; adapt spatial planning to increased risks of landslides; research on how climate change affects the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services and how negative effects can be limited).
The Integrated Climate and Energy Policy also contains action plans to promote renewable energy, improve energy efficiency and implement measures leading to a fossil-independent transportation sector.
Targets outlined in this legislation include:
– 40% GHGs from non-ETS sectors by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels)
– 50% of energy consumption from renewable energy by 2020
– 20% more efficient energy use (compared to 2008)
– 10% renewable energy in the transportation sector
– by 2020: a phase out of fossil fuels in heating
– by 2030: a vehicle fleet that is independent of fossil fuels
– by 2050: zero net emissions of GHGs in Sweden.",http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/an-integrated-climate-and-energy-policy-outlined-in-government-bills-200809-162-and-200809-163/

The objective of the PIMA Air Plan was to reduce CO2‚ and NOx‚ emission and particle pollution by subsidies for renovating the commercial vehicle fleets. The main beneficiaries of this initiative were self-employed professionals and businesses, who will be encouraged to replace their old light commercial vehicles with more efficient. The Plan established the rules for the direct aid for the purchase of new and used vehicles (up to one year old) up to 3.5 tonnes maximum authorized weight. The amount of aid amounted to EUR 1 000‚ per vehicle, for vehicles of weight less than 2 500 kg and EUR 2 000€‚ for vehicles of weight over 2 500 kg. Since October 25th, 2013, electric motorcycles, scooters, and bikes were also included to this incentives program (“Plan PIMA Air 2”), with incentives up to 400 EUR, 250 EUR, and 200 EUR respectively per category. Incentives of Plan PIMA Air can be added to the MOVELE Program incentives, but not to the PIVE Program. During 2014, the third edition of the PIMA Air program (“PIMA Air 3”) was running, funded with a budget of 5.5 million EUR, and a number of 2,671 commercial vehicles were renewed and a number of 2,468 electric bicycles were acquired in this frame.

The agriculture and waste sectors are set to reduce emissions by 29% and 21% respectively. Emissions of the industry sector are projected to increase 45%.
Besides GHG emissions targets, Macedonia presents sectoral targets for renewable energy sources. Renewables are expected to be responsible for 66% share of electricity generation, 38% of the final energy consumption overall, 45% in the heating and cooling and 10% of the final energy consumption in the transport sector.

""In 2012, energy from renewable sources was estimated to have contributed 14.1% of EU final energy consumption and should reach the objective of 20% in 2020. Looking beyond 2020, the Commission has proposed to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27% by 2030.""
""Coal and lignite's CO2-emissions mean that they only have a long-term future in the EU if using Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS also offers the potential to further improve gas and oil recovery that would otherwise remain untapped. Therefore, bearing in mind the rather limited uptake of CCS to date, further efforts in research, development and deployment should be made in order to fully benefit from this technology.""
""The Union's energy security is inseparable from the 2030 framework for climate and energy and should be agreed together by the European Council. The transition to a competitive, low-carbon economy will reduce the use of imported fossil fuels by moderating energy demand and exploiting renewable and other indigenous sources of energy.""

The Law introduces several development schemes for the private development of renewable energy projects, including competitive bids, feed-in tariff, and independent power production through third party access.
Competitive bidding to be run by the New and Renewable Energy Authority (“NREA”) open to private sector companies for construction of the renewable power projects. Constructed stations will be operated by NREA. Produced electricity will be sold to Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC) at a regulated price determined by Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (ERA).
Competitive bidding mechanism for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts to be run by EETC and open to private companies for construction, ownership and operation of the renewable power projects. Generated electricity will be sold to EETC on the price agreed between EETC and plant owner.
Feed-in tariff (FIT) support system under which private sector investors are allowed to build, own and operate renewable energy power stations and sell generated electricity to EETC or to licensed distribution companies via power purchase agreements (PPA). PPA determines duration of the contract and a fix electricity price (feed-in tariff). PPA for feed-in tariffs for solar installations will last 20 years, for wind projects 25 years. Egypt aims to deploy 4300 MW of new renewable capacity under FIT scheme between 2015 and 2017. FIT system is open only for solar PV and wind technologies.
Independent power production through third party access scheme allows independent power producers (IPP) to enter bilateral electricity purchase contracts with eligible consumers and sell them produced electricity directly. EETC must allow for conclusion of such contract and make grid network available. In this case, EETC is allowed to charge and collect greed access fee for grid usage.",https://thelawreviews.co.uk/edition/the-renewable-energy-law-review-edition-3/1229892/egypt

The objective of this Regulation is to protect the environment by reducing emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Accordingly, this Regulation:
(a) establishes rules on containment, use, recovery and destruction of fluorinated greenhouse gases, and on related ancillary measures;
(b) imposes conditions on the placing on the market of specific products and equipment that contain, or whose functioning relies upon, fluorinated greenhouse gases;
(c) imposes conditions on specific uses of fluorinated greenhouse gases; and
(d) establishes quantitative limits for the placing on the market of hydrofluorocarbons.
Non-CO2 emissions, including fluorinated greenhouse gases but excluding non-CO2 emissions from agriculture, should be reduced by 72 % to 73 % by 2030 and by 70 % to 78 % by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. If based on the reference year 2005, a reduction in non-CO2 emissions, except those from agriculture, of 60 % to 61 % by 2030 is required. Fluorinated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at 90 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalent in 2005.
The Commission report of 26 September 2011 on the application, effects and adequacy of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) concluded that the current containment measures, if fully applied, have the potential to reduce emissions of fluorinated greenhouse gases. Those measures should therefore be maintained and clarified on the basis of the experience gained in implementing them

However, on 25th April 2011, the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020 has been approved. Some of the main actions envisioned in the Doctrine are setting a price on carbon, and enhancing energy efficiency and the expansion of renewables and alternative energy sources.
The new version of the Doctrine from October 2023 deletes the statement that the human influence on climate change is mainly linked to emissions, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels.
The energy targets presented in the Doctrine are: to reduce the share of energy generated from natural gas to 46% or 47% by 2030 (from more than 50% currently); doubling the capacity of nuclear power plants; increase the share of electricity produced from renewables to 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020; and limit the burning of gas produced from oil wells. RE target of 1.5% by 2010, 2.5% by 2015 and 4.5% by 2020 was superseded in 2014 by the State Program on Energy efficiency and Energy Development. Followed by the Comprehensive Plan for Implementation of the Climate Doctrine to 2020.
National, regional and local authorities are responsible for producing and implementing action plans that are in line with the Doctrine, creating fiscal and financial incentives for the development and deployment of technologies that enhance energy efficiency, and lead to adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, the responsibility to adopt measures that lead to energy efficiency in vehicles, building, services and the production of heat and electricity rest with the enterprises themselves.

In the electricity and heat sector, it supports renewable energy (100% by 2030). Also, codes and standards are set aiming for energy efficiency of end users’ devices and a fuel switch is promoted by a moratorium on exploration and exploitation of fossil fuels.
The building sector is tackled with codes and standards driving for a more sustainable construction and material efficiency. Moreover, in the industry sector, renewable and low carbon energy are supported to move away from carbon-based production and towards a circular economy. Fiscal, tariffs and other price instruments are the base to support the forestry sector in order to achieve 60% of forest cover in the country without jeopardising the agricultural sector (Costa Rica NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, Costa Rica’s updated NDC has unconditional targets +2°C compatible. There is room for improvement by specifying the sectoral breakdown or the contribution of the forestry sector, and also by pushing for bolder goals in order to be 1.5°C compatible. CAT calculations show that when excluding LULUCF the total emissions in 2030 will be 12.3 to 12.9 MtCO2e in 2030, though there is some uncertainty due to the forestry contribution (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

The sectors covered by the target are energy (supply and demand), industrial processes, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste and the gases covered are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbon (PFCs), sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).
Republic of Korea underscores a plan to reduce its GHG emissions using a carbon market mechanism, the K-ETS, which covers 73.5% of national emissions. Moreover, Korea set its Korean Green New Deal focusing on green transition in cities, low-carbon energy, and innovative less carbon intensive industries.
In the electricity sector it focuses on the reduction of coal power generation through the ban on new coal-fired power plants, switching to eco-friendlier fuels. Also, Korea plans to increase the share of renewable energy up to 20% by 2030. In the industry sector the reliance lies on highly-efficient equipment which will reduce the consumption of fossil fuels. In the building sector, Korea pledges to 'greening' public buildings by upgrading standards of energy consumption. In the transportation sector, Korea has set a target of e-mobile vehicles by 2030 and a modal shift in freight transport from road to rail. All of these actions are embedded in the Korean New Green Deal plan (Republic of Korea NDC, 2020).
According to CAT, the update of its NDC is 'Highly insufficient"". The NDC is economy-wide and now has an absolute target: 24.4% below 2017 emissions by 2030. In CAT calculations, this would be equivalent to 540 MtCO2 by 2030. However, these emissions would be reached including international credits and LULUCF sink.

It identified key elements of the country’s low-carbon and climate resilient growth and worked with the MPND to integrate climate change into the 2013-2017 Medium Term Plan.
Subcomponent 2: Enabling Policy and Regulatory Framework reviewed international, regional and national policy and legislative instruments related to climate change to form the basis for developing a policy and legislative framework to promote coherence, coordination and cooperative governance of climate change issues for Kenya.
Subcomponent 3: Adaptation Analysis and Prioritisation undertook a comprehensive review of all relevant literature to identify and prioritise immediate, medium- and longterm adaptation actions. The proposed actions informed the 2013-2017 Medium Term Plan and National Adaptation Plan.
Subcomponent 4: Mitigation actions examined potential low-carbon development opportunities in the six mitigation sectors set out in Article 4.1 of the UNFCCC: energy; transport; industry; agriculture; forestry; and waste management. The analysis provided the basis for identifying potential internationally and domestically supported NAMAs that would enhance sustainable development. Identifying priority REDD+ activities was also addressed.
Subcomponent 5: The Technology chapter has drawn attention to the barriers affecting the uptake of technologies related to adaptation and mitigations. A national technology needs assessment has been undertaken separately to this action plan.
Subcomponent 6: National Performance and Benefit Measurement developed a national performance and benefit measurement framework for measuring, monitoring, evaluating, verifying and reporting results of mitigation actions, adaptation actions and the synergies between them.
Subcomponent 7: Knowledge Management and Capacity Development designed a knowledge management system to address the sharing of climate change-related knowledge and proposed capacity building measures to address the institutional and technical capacity needs of the various actors.
Subcomponent 8: Finance developed an innovative financial mechanism that includes a climate fund, investment strategy/framework and carbon trading platform to position the country to access finances from various sources.",https://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Kenya-National-Climate-Change-Action-Plan.pdf

The plan seeks to improve energy efficiency and cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by developing renewable energy and expanding nuclear power capacity. The plan aims to cut energy consumption per unit of GDP by 3-5% per year. It also aims at increasing the share of renewable energy to 16% by 2030, and transport fuel from alternative sources such as gas or biofuels to 20% by 2020. The plan contains data on the greenhouse gas emissions in the Czech Republic, including projections of future development, and presents proposals for concrete measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and for adaptation measures. The programme was reviewed in 2007, and the review adopted by the government in April 2008. The review pointed to significant increase in the use of renewable energy sources, as well as progress in the agriculture and water management sectors. However, it found the Czech Republics energy intensity and GHG emissions per capita were comparatively high, and that transport sector emissions continued to increase. The National Climate Change Plan is thus being reviewed to emphasise measures targeting the industry and transport sectors, which contribute the most to GHG emissions, as well as to take into account the evolution of domestic, European and global political negotiations on climate change since 2004.

The NEP includes a target to reduce energy-related GHG emissions to 15%; however, there is little detail on the nature of this target, such as a date by when it should be achieved.
The NEP also calls for a revival of Nigeria’s coal sector, which currently provides a negligible contribution to the country’s energy supply. The policy targets a 30% share of coal in the country’s energy mix, which we assume refers to the power mix. While the government has handed out 36 coal mining licences tied to 10,000 MW of coal capacity, none of the projects have been successful (Daily Trust, 2019). To be compatible with the Paris Agreement, coal power generation across Africa would need to be phased out by 2034 (Parra et al., 2019).",https://www.energy.gov.ng/Energy_Policies_Plan/National%20Energy%20Policy.pdf

It is the first energy-related strategic document to be adopted in Poland in 12 years. It offers suggestions for achieving EU climate and energy targets, such as building offshore wind capacity or starting the nation's first nuclear power plant in 2033.
A just and inclusive energy transition toward an emissions-free system built on innovation, sustainable economic growth, enhanced efficiency, and competitiveness is at the core of PEP2040. The improved air quality, which addresses a significant issue across the nation, is the final important factor. The following metrics should be used to gauge progress toward these objectives in the 2030 perspective: (I) a maximum 56% share of coal-fired power generation (with a conservatively estimated exit date of 2049); (II) a minimum 23% share of renewable electricity in final consumption (32% in power generation, 14% in transport); (III) the addition of nuclear power generation by 2033; (IV) a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 30% (compared to 1990 levels); and (V)

Switzerland sets a target of at least 50% reduction of 1990 GHG emission levels (54.1 MtCO2e) by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. Also, Switzerland proposes 75% of the target as a domestic share of its reduction and 25% to be achieved abroad. Besides this single-year target, the NDC also proposes a multi-year between 2021-2030 in which the country will reach an average reduction of GHG of at least 35% below 1990 emissions.
The Swiss government underscores the Energy Strategy 2050 that is yet to enter into force. In this strategy, it is foreseen an increase in renewable sources for power generation, both from hydropower (37,400 GWh) and others (reaching 11,400 GWh). 
The second approach is to halt fossil fuel subsidies, which are being reviewed at national level embedded in a normative goal of transitioning towards a low carbon economy. At international level, agreements of cooperation have been signed with other countries (Switzerland NDC, 2020).
CAT evaluates Switzerland updated NDC 'Insufficient'. The country pledged a reduction of 50% relative to 1990 GHG emissions by 2030 and now the pledge is at least 50% and the pledge to reach net-zero by 2050.  Moreover, according to CAT calculations, the new pledge to achieve 75% of the overall target through domestic emissions reduction can be translated into a domestic absolute target of 37.5% below 1990 levels by 2030, lacking 12.5% to be achieved internationally (Climate Action Tracker, 2021). CAT draws attention that considering the current policies Switzerland will not achieve the domestic target, with special concern in the transport sector.","https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Switzerland%20First/Switzerland_Full%20NDC%20Communication%202021-2030%20incl%20ICTU.pdf

These outcome-focused regulations apply to upstream oil and gas facilities, which are responsible for extraction, production, processing and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. The requirements target two key methane sources: fugitive emissions, which are unintentional leaks from equipment leaks, and venting emissions, which are intentional releases of methane into the air.
General requirements apply to all covered upstream oil and gas facilities:
Compressors: As of January 1, 2020, covered compressors will be required to take action to conserve or destroy methane, or else to meet applicable vent limits. If a company opts not to conserve or destroy methane, it must demonstrate compliance with the limits via an annual measurement or continuous monitoring. Corrective action is required if those emissions exceed the limit applicable to the compressor, which depends on the installation date, the type of compressor, and its rated brake power.
Well completions involving hydraulic fracturing: As of January 1, 2020, these sites must conserve or destroy gas in most circumstances instead of venting it into the air.
Conditional requirements apply to covered upstream oil and gas facilities handling significant volumes (at least 60,000 cubic metres/year of gas):
Fugitive equipment leaks: As of January 1, 2020, upstream oil and gas facilities are required to start implementation of leak detection and repair program consisting of three comprehensive inspections per year at most upstream oil and gas facilities. Corrective action is required if leaks are discovered.
Facility production venting: As of January 1, 2023, upstream oil and gas facilities must limit annual facility vented volumes of methane to 15,000 m3. These facilities would need to capture the gas and either use it onsite, re-inject it underground, send it to a sales pipeline, or route it to a destruction device. This requirement does not apply to vented gas from:
-specific temporary activities such as emergencies, liquids unloading, or equipment start-ups, shutdowns, and blowdowns;
-facilities that have vented less than 40,000 m3 in the past year without destroying or selling or re-injecting any gas; and
-processing equipment such as glycol dehydrators, compressors and pneumatic devices.
Pneumatic devices:
-Controllers: As of January 1, 2023, facilities using natural-gas-powered pneumatic controllers must ensure that on-going emissions remain below 0.17m³ per hour.
-Pumps: As of January 1, 2023, pneumatic pumps are prohibited from emitting methane where the volume of liquid being pumped exceeds 20 litres per day.

In a first step to completely phase out fossil fuels the government targets the drop in the consumption of oil, gas and coal by 33% between 2009 and 2020.
The share of thermal production in total energy generation should also decrease from 71% to 40% over the same period.
To reach 100% of electricity from renewable, the Danish government greatly focuses on wind energy, expected to provide for 40% of total electricity needs, together with biomass and biogas. A solid district heating network, fed by renewable heat from biomass, will be the main motor of the energy transition in the heating sector.
Full independence from fossil fuels will also be reached through a solid and long term energy efficiency policy aiming at reducing gross energy consumption by 6% from 2006 levels. Energy companies will be required to increase energy savings by 50% in 2013 and 75% by 2017 to 2020. Electric meters diffusion will participate in moniotring energy demand in the residential sector.
In the building sector, the Danish government is going a step forward in implementing very ambitious building code, banning oil boilers in all new constructions and, by 2017, in all houses while biomass, biogas and solar thermal appliances will be strongly encouraged.
Denmark also targets the large scale deployment of offshore wind as well as dramatic growth in the wind manufacturing sector, and will fund research and development in for solar and wave power, support main demonstration projects for large heat pumps intended to be used in district heating plants and fund other geothermal energy research projects.
In order to generate revenues to finance the energy shift of the country, Denmark will introduce a public service obligation tax on electricity and gas, while tax on oil, gas and coal will be further increased to discourage their use.

The program encompasses various legislative amendments aimed at achieving these goals. Here's a breakdown:
Amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG 2023):
Aims to increase the share of renewable energies in gross electricity consumption to at least 80% by 2030.
Incorporates measures such as expanding wind and solar power by 80% by 2030, promoting electricity storage and power plants using green hydrogen, increasing remuneration for solar systems, facilitating the establishment of citizen energy companies, enhancing financial participation of municipalities in wind energy, and eliminating levies for electricity self-supply.
References the 1.5-degree path outlined in the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.
Amendment to the Onshore Wind Energy Act (WaLG):
Regulates area targets for designating wind energy areas, aiming for 1.4% of the federal area by the end of 2027 and 2% by the end of 2032.
Amendment to the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BNatSchG):
Aims to streamline the approval process for wind turbines while maintaining high environmental standards.
Recognizes wind turbine operation as being in the public interest, facilitating exemptions.
Simplifies the assessment of species protection exceptions and alternatives, particularly for repowering onshore wind turbines.
Amendment of the Building Energy Act (GEG):
Introduces mandatory requirements for installing climate-friendly heating systems in new homes, with at least 65% powered by renewable energy starting January 2024.
Allows existing heating systems to continue use with transition periods and exemptions.
Provides social compensation payments and a KfW subsidy program.
These amendments collectively aim to bridge the climate protection gap by up to 80%, aligning with Germany's climate targets and commitments under international agreements like the Paris Agreement.","https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/klimaschutz/20231004-klimaschutzprogramm-der-bundesregierung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10

230206138,Nationally Determined Contribution - NDC United Kingdom (2022),United Kingdom,"Climate strategy, Political & non-binding climate strategy, GHG reduction target, Political & non-binding GHG reduction target",General,"The UK resubmitted its 2020 NDC target in 2022. Its latest NDC, however, provides more detail on additional information that improves transparency around the UK's decarbonization plans.
The UK's NDC covers all sectors and gases. For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. The UK’s overall absolute target is to reduce GHG emissions at least by 68% (including LULUCF) by 2030 compared with reference levels. Emissions from International Aviation and Shipping are not included.
The UK has a policy framework in force establishing the binding commitment of net zero emissions by 2050, and Scotland sets bolder goals to reach net-zero in 2045 and 75% below 1990 by 2030. Wales pledges at least 80% reduction by 2050. 
The Climate Change Act introduced carbon budgets for the UK Government, which cap emissions over successive five-year periods and must be set 12 years in advance.
The UK government is putting into force the Clean Growth Strategy, which is a Ten Point Plan for a green industrial revolution, encompassing clean energy, buildings, transport and technologies. Moreover, the government pushes for individual plans across key sectors such as Energy White Paper, Transport Decarbonisation Plan and Heat and Buildings Strategy (UK NDC, 2020).
UK’s NDC establishes a reduction of 68% of 1990 levels including LULUCF emissions. If LULUCF is excluded, this is equivalent to 69% or 251 MtCO2e. CAT classifies this as strong target and once the UK adopts national policies (2030 ban on the sale of fossil fuel cars and a ramping up of renewable energy investment, particularly into offshore wind) it will bring their emissions in line with the 1.5°C goal. Also, the UK has a net-zero goal by 2050. CAT cannot rate, at this moment, the UK target due to complexities derived from Brexit (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

This new directive modernises and strengthens the rules concerning the social and environmental information that companies have to report. A broader set of large companies, as well as listed SMEs, will now be required to report on sustainability.
The new rules will ensure that investors and other stakeholders have access to the information they need to assess the impact of companies on people and the environment and for investors to assess financial risks and opportunities arising from climate change and other sustainability issues. Finally, reporting costs will be reduced for companies over the medium to long term by harmonising the information to be provided.
The first companies will have to apply the new rules for the first time in the 2024 financial year, for reports published in 2025.
Companies subject to the CSRD will have to report according to European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). The standards were developed by the EFRAG, previously known as the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group, an independent body bringing together various different stakeholders.
The ESRS were published in the Official Journal on 22 December 2023 under the form of a delegated regulation. They are tailored to EU policies, while building on and contributing to international standardisation initiatives.

By the end of the Strategy third implementation phase, the proportion of Eastern energy markets in the Russian energy export of liquid hydrocarbons (oil and oil products) should grow from the current 6 to 22–25%, while natural gas export should grow from 0 to 19–20%. The Strategy sets a 56 percent energy intensity reduction target for 2030 (compared with 2005). It will be accomplished in three stages: the first is a major overhaul of the energy sector; the second emphasizes efficiency gains through new technology within the fuel and energy sectors; and the third stresses economy-wide energy efficiency. The targets for each phase for the various indicators can be found in Annex 3 of the document. To be updated by Energy Strategy of Russia to 2035.

In this submission, Norway committed to a reduction of at least 50% and towards 55% compared to 1990 levels by 2030 (52 MtCO2e excluding LULUCF). Norway will implement its NDC jointly with the EU and Iceland, nevertheless it intends to go beyond the EU in the target of 40%, using voluntary collaboration under Article 6 of Paris Agreement.
Economic measures like CO2- taxes and emission trading are central to Norwegian climate policy, but also CCS technologies, electric vehicles and renewable energy will be supported. The following policy instruments are outlined: the EU-ETS; Effort Sharing Regulation (ERS), regulating carbon emissions that fall outside EU-ETS, whereby the Norwegian binding target is to reduce emissions by 40% in 2030 compared with 2005; and LULUCF, which is ought to reach net zero by 2030 (Norway NDC, 2020).
CAT evaluates Norway’s updated NDC as a progress but still insufficient to reach Paris Agreement goals. The present target establishes a reduction of at least 50% relative to 1990 levels by 2030, aiming for 55% (47 – 52% excluding LULUCF according to CAT).

However, the targets are conditional to international aid.  The base year used in this NDC was 2011, which the net emissions calculated was 31,998.91Gg CO2e and the BAU was projected for each sector.
In the energy generation sector, Nepal proposes to expand clean energy generation from 1,400 MW to 15,000 MW, being 5,000 MW unconditionally, ensuring that 15% of the total energy demand in the country will be supplied by clean sources.  Nepal also states that 5-10 % of such clean energy will be generated from mini and micro-hydro power, solar, wind and bio-energy. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the transport sector, Nepal pledges that, by 2025, 25% of the sales of all private passenger vehicles will correspond to electric vehicles (including 2 wheelers), and 20% of all four-wheelers. This target will reduce 8% of the emissions compared with the BAU scenario. Moreover, by 2030 the share of sales will reach up to 90% of all vehicles and 60% considering all four-wheelers, which corresponds to a reduction of 23% compared with the BAU scenario. (Nepal, NDC 2020)
In the residential sector, Nepal focuses on the improvement of cookstoves, ensuring 25% of electric stoves by 2030 and in the installation of biogas plants (household units and large scale). Nepal aims to reduce 23% of the emissions compared with BAU. Lastly, in the AFOLU sector, Nepal relies on forest conservation (45% of the country by 2030) and sustainable management of 50% of Tarai and Inner Tarai forests and 25% of middle hills and mountain forests (Nepal, NDC 2020).
Climate Action Tracker (2021) in its own calculation compiling all BAU sectors and sectoral reductions to an economy wide one, outlined that the new conditional NDC would reduce 1.9 – 5.6 MtCO2e, leading to emissions levels between 69 - 76 MtCO2e in 2030.

NDC’s implementation timeframe spans from 2020 to 2030. In this scenario, 991 MtCO2e were quantified in 2030. They posited an unconditional contribution to reduce 22% of GHG emissions and a conditional contribution of up to 36% reduction below BAU, 774 MtCO2 and 638 MtCO2, respectively (Climate Action Tracker, 2020).
Mexico plans to cover all sectors. In a cross sectoral approach, the main measures outlined are Emission Trade System; Climate Finance Strategy, Circular Economy, Efficient Use of Energy. In the transport sector, Mexico aims the strengthening of regulations applicable to motor vehicles, the encouragement of alternative transportation systems, the promotion of clean transportation programs, the development and implementation of the National Electric Mobility Strategy and urban planning. In the electricity sector, it aims to increase participation of renewables, storage and smarter grids. Additionally, in the building sector the focus is on projects that optimize energy consumption in buildings and reduce the impacts of new constructions; to promote mechanisms and regulations that encourage the inclusion of best practices in constructions. Energy efficiency and circular economy are the kernel for the industrial sector.
According to Climate Action Tracker (2020), although both conditional and unconditional remained unchanged from Mexico’s 2016 NDC, its emission projections under BAU has been revised upwards. Therefore, the mitigation ambition has decreased.
After being challenged in court, Mexico's 2020 NDC targets have been suspended and 2016 NDC targets have been reinstated.","https://www4.unfccc.int/sites/ndcstaging/PublishedDocuments/Mexico%20First/NDC-Eng-Dec30.pdf

Under the 2008 Climate Change Act, the UK must meet legally binding carbon ""budgets"", committing the UK to cuts its emissions by 34% by 2020 and 80% by 2050.
The Strategy comprises three primary 2020 targets:
Over 30% of electricity to be generated from renewable energy sources, mostly from wind power, with biomass, hydro, wave and tidal power playing important roles;
12% of heat to be generated from renewable energy sources, from a large range of sources (biomass, biogas, solar, heat pumps);
10% of transport energy to come from renewable energy sources.
The key measures to achieve the targets are:
An expansion and extension of the Renewables Obligation, requiring energy suppliers to sell larger amounts of renewable energy. New measures to increase financial support for offshore wind will also be considered.
Introducing payment schemes to support the production of renewable heat and small-scale clean electricity generation by households, industry, businesses and communities.
New guaranteed payments will be provided through feed-in tariff schemes from 2010 onwards, and a Renewable Heat Incentive from 2011 onwards. Before the schemes take effect, GBP 45 million in grants have been committed.
The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation will be amended or replaced, taking into account sustainability issues, to ensure transport fuels contain a rising amount of renewable biofuels.",https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228866/7686.pdf

Hydroenergy is the most usable RE type in the country. In order to reach 30% of RE presence in the national energy mix Program outlines that:
1. New huge hydro power plants (HPP) will be build:
a- Meghri HPP on the river Araks, expected production in 2017;
b- Shnogh HPP on the river Debed, contracts not signed yet therefore no estimation on potential time of production;
c- Loriberd HPP on the river Dzoraget, contracts not signed yet therefore no estimation on potential time of exploitation yet.
2. Existing HPPs (Vorotan HPP Complex and Dzora HPP) will undergo renovation
3. Steps to attract private investors will be taken.
Upon completion of the Strategic Development Program of Hydroenergy Sector of the Republic of Armenia it is expected that following targets will be achieved:
1- Additional 570 MW of electricity production will be added;
2- The share of renewable energy sources in annual domestic electricity production will increase;
3- The reliability of the electricity system will increase;
4- The energy dependence of Armenia from importing fossil fuels will considerably decrease;
5- The greenhouse gas emissions will decrease. IEA/IRENA Global Renewable Energy Policies and Measures Database © OECD/IEA and IRENA, [November 2020]",https://eneken.ieej.or.jp/data/3921.pdf

Together they create a trust fund for renewables, define the incentives for renewable independent power producers and determine the framework for renewable energy auctions.
The Law 27191 is an amendment to the Law 26190 and extends the national commitment for renewable energy promotion up to 2025.
With regard to renewable the set targets are,
- A share of renewables of at least 8% of total electricity consumption by 31 Dec 2017;
- A share of renewables of at least 12% of total electricity consumption by 31 Dec 2019;
- A share of renewables of at least 16% of total electricity consumption by 31 Dec 2021;
- A share of renewables of at least 18% of total electricity consumption by 31 Dec 2023;
- A share of renewables of at least 20% of total electricity consumption by 31 Dec 2025;
Furthermore, large energy users (demand > 300kW) are obliged to reach these targets individually, or pay a penalty. The price of tradable renewable electricity is capped at US$113/MWh. The law provides a series of tax benefits to new renewable projects (accelerated amortization in income tax, income tax relief in profits re-invested in renewables, VAT refund, fiscal certificates, feed-in tariffs etc.) over a period of 10 years. The law also establishes the Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER) to support renewables projects. The law covers all main types of renewable sources. The feed-in tariffs previously established through law 26.190 apply to renewable projects sharing electricity into the public grid and have the following values: $0.9/kWh for solar PVs and $0.015/kWh for all other types of renewable energy.","http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8d1fbf01-aad6-48aa-ab93-2e694a2d0051

It highlights the progress made in the sector, its future needs and emissions, and the ways for the sector to reduce its carbon emissions. It sets a new emissions reduction target of 26% by 2030, compared to 2015. The goals highlighted in the roadmap are:
- enhancing energy efficiency (reducing annual GHG emissions by 1.8 MtCO2 equivalent between 2015 and 2030);
- nitrous oxide (N2O) reduction (-0.8 MtCO2 eq)
- lowering emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) (-0.9 MtCO2 eq).
- generating low-carbon heat (1.4 MtCO2 equivalent for heat from biomass and -0.8 MtCO2 equivalent for heat from Solid Recovered Fuel - SRF).
The plan advocates the use of several measures to guarantee affordable and dependable supply to low-carbon electricity while offering rewards for energy conservation, such as:
- Instruments to facilitate an industry-wide supply of competitive low-carbon energy; 
- Extending and protecting the public electricity network's interruptibility and rate-reduction measures;

It is an economy-wide NDC covering all the sectors and major greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O. Brunei Darussalam aims to achieve the intended GHG emissions reductions under this NDC through domestic actions and financing.
Brunei Darussalam National Climate Change Policy (BNCCP), established strategies for the transition towards a low carbon economy. In the transportation sector, the total share of electric vehicles will be increased to 60% by 2035. For this, incentives will be put in place. In the electricity sector, Brunei plans to increase renewable energy to 30% by 2035 investing in solar energy. Also, reduce by 10% GHG emissions increasing energy efficiency in supply and demand side. In industrial sector, the policy instrument chosen is carbon pricing, which means that a price will be imposed on carbon emissions by 2025 (Brunei NDC, 2020).

The NDC presentsa reference scenario of 345MTCO2e emission by 2030 and envisages a mitigation scenario of 169.44MTCO2 - 51% of mitigation. Furthermore, its end goal is to be a net-zero country in 2050.
For that some overarching actions are proposed between 2021 and 2030, for instance set a carbon cap by 2023 and reduce deforestation with international aid to a net zero by 2030 or to 50.000ha unconditionally.
The policy focuses on the 6 mitigation areas, overarching sectors. The NDC presents the use of codes and standards to reduce energy consumption, support sustainable constructions and replace old and out-dated devices and vehicles. The carbon pricing and tax aim to reduce the use of fossil fuels and also create revenue to invest in renewables. In the electricity area, the NDC mentions an improvement in energy efficiency to optimise the dispatch of electrical energy and the promotion and diversification of the energy matrix and exploitation of natural gas from landfills. In the building sector, improving performance appliances are pointed as a way forward. In the transport sector the NDC outlines the creation of a regulatory and financial environment that allows accelerating the transition towards electric mobility and Modernisation of HDV and, lastly, in the industry sector the fuel switch to a less intensive one will reduce the emissions of CO2e and in the LULUCF ecological restoration and reduction of deforestation are the core (Colombia NDC, 2020).

-Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), including maritime, aviation and CORSIA as well as a proposal for ETS as own resource. In December 2022, the Council reached a provisional political agreement on the reform.
-Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and a proposal for CBAM as own resource
-Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR)
-Revision of the Energy Tax Directive
-Amendment to the Renewable Energy Directive to implement the ambition of the new 2030 climate target (RED)
-Amendment of the Energy Efficiency Directive to implement the ambition of the new 2030 climate target (EED)
-Revision of the Regulation on the inclusion of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)
-Revision of the Directive on deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure
-Revision of the Regulation setting CO? emission performance standards for new passenger cars and for new light commercial vehicles
According to the CAT, instead of the current emissions reduction of 43% between 2005 and 2030, it should result in emissions reductions of 61% in the same period. The emissions reduction goal in the non-EU ETS sectors has also been increased from 30% to 40% below 2005, with binding national emissions reduction targets between 10% and 50%.
The “Fit for 55” package also includes proposals for a higher share of renewables and increased energy efficiency. The target for the share of renewables in energy consumption has been increased from 32% to 40%, with an additional indicative share of 49% of renewables in the buildings sector. According to the proposal, at least 50% of hydrogen used in the industry should be generated from renewables.
On the package’s new energy efficiency goals, by 2030, EU member states should reduce their total primary energy consumption to no more than 1,023 Mtoe instead of the previous target’s 1,128 Mtoe. Their final energy consumption should not exceed 787 Mtoe.

Croatian National Energy Strategy 2009-2020 has three basic objectives: 1) increase security of energy supply, 2) develop competitive energy system and 3) ensure sustainable energy sector development. These objectives are particularly important due to Croatia’s heavy dependence on energy imports which results in country’s vulnerability to energy prices volatilities.
Targets:
- decrease by 20% greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 taking emissions level of 1990 as a baseline;
- increase share of renewable energy by 20% in annual gross energy consumption of the country by 2020;
- cover 10% of energy consumption in all transport sector with energy derived from renewable sources by 2020;
- decrease final energy consumption by 9% by 2016.

The Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte (Energy transition for green growth law), a national framework strategy for 2015, incorporates the policy. Additionally, it is an endeavor to control and promote a circular economy. Minerals are one of the natural resources covered in the Resources for France plan. Despite not being a large producer of essential minerals, France has recognized since the 2010s that its needs are growing due to the energy transition and the digitalization. The strategy includes essential minerals because France is heavily dependent on imports.
The Comité pour les métaux stratégiques (COMES) and the Bureau de recherches géologiques et minières (BRGM) are tasked with doing a more thorough mapping of the requirements for essential minerals in relation to the energy transition. 
The strategy also emphasizes recycling as a viable production technique for industrialized nations like France. It urges further investigation into secondary mineral resources.
The proposal also suggests incorporating sustainability standards into the chain of production for vital minerals. Reusing and recycling are viewed as an alternate method to guarantee a local, sustainable supply. The strategy does, however, draw attention to the necessity of a European initiative on social and environmental standards for mining.
The circular economy is supported by policy in part thanks to this five-year strategy. It takes into account the social and environmental effects of key minerals in addition to their economic and security repercussions. This strategy is being developed simultaneously at the national and regional levels; some of the goals outlined in the Resources for France plan are also included in the European Commission's adopted 2020 Circular Economy Action Plan.

Regarding sectoral policies, the document highlights several goals. ""In the transport sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 29% reduction in emissions over the 2015-2028 period, notably by improving the energy efficiency of vehicles consuming 2 litres per 100km and developing clean vehicles (electric cars, biofuels, etc.). In agriculture, the SNBC aims to achieve a 12% reduction in emissions through the implementation of the agroecology project. This will involve methanisation, ground cover, maintaining pastureland, developing the agroforestry sector and optimising the use of inputs. In the industrial sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 24% emissions reduction, notably by improving energy efficiency, which is also a source of competitiveness, growing the circular economy (reuse, recycling, energy recovery, etc.) and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources. In the waste management sector, the SNBC aims to achieve a 33% reduction in emissions, by reducing food waste, developing the concept of eco-design, fighting planned obsolescence, promoting reuse and improving waste recovery efforts.""","https://www.gouvernement.fr/en/adoption-of-the-national-low-carbon-strategy-for-climate

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.

The state targets the installation of 1 to 1.2 GW of solar capacity by 2022, seeks to enhance energy security, create jobs in the solar manufacturing and become a main exporter of renewable power to third party and neighboring states. To reach such targets, the solar policy includes a combination of support tools: First, power producers are exempted from electricity duty on the energy they consume and can apply for incentives under the Industry Scheme. Producers of solar thermal energy are granted access to the water quantity required for generation by local authorities and solar power will be guaranteed grid access under both the Indian Solar Mission and the Rajasthan Solar policy. The solar policy seeks to widespread the installation of solar water heating systems on all industrial buildings where hot water is required, large residential buildings, government and private hospitals, hotels and swimming pools. Solar steam systems in residential institutions and hospitals will also be supported. Second, the solar policy creates the RE infrastructure Development Fund to finance transmission network extension, road construction and ease the integration of RE generation. Such Fund will be financed by the collection of a development charge of INR. 10 Lacs per MW installed transfered to the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation. The policy also provides for the regulation framework to develop solar parks larger than 1, 000 MW capacity. Such Parks will include Solar Power Plants, Manufacturing Zones, R & D and Training Centres. Third, the Solar Policy creates the Solar Research Center of excellence. The solar policy will fulfill Rajasthan s engagements in the National Solar Mission -install 66 MW of solar capacity- and install additional capacity following a competitive bidding process. Central government will tender 50 MW of solar PV and 50 MW of solar thermal and best bidders will be guaranteed a fixed price by Discoms of Rajasthan. Moreover, the policy will promote the installation of solar PV and solar thermal plans for direct sale to Discoms of Rajasthan with a maximum capacity of 200 MW by 2013 and an additional 400 MW by 2017. Eligible projects will also be selected through auctions. The state will promote off grid and decentralised solar applications and hybrid systems in replacement of diesel based generators. The solar policy also facilitates the installation of solar power producers targeting solar power trade with third party or other states.

Quantification: Carbon removal activities need to be measured accurately and deliver unambiguous benefits for the climate;
Additionality: Carbon removal activities need to go beyond existing practices and what is required by law;
Long-term storage: Certificates are linked to the duration of carbon storage so as to ensure permanent storage;

The NDC sets an unconditional target of 95 MtCO2e by 2030. Also included 2025 as the peak year and a cap of emissions in the current decade of 1100MtCO2e.
For the LULUCF sector, Chile focuses on forest restoration, afforestation and reducing deforestation as carbon sink. The final goal is to reach neutrality by 2050.
Chile planns to strengthen its policy legal framework, exchange technology with international actors and build capacity through education at national level. Also, public-private alliances are supported by the government to finance action. In the building sector, Chile relies on targets, codes and standards and in the transport envisages to incite e-mobility and hydrogen to replace diesel. Fuel switching is also the way forward in the industry sector, from coal to electricity and biogas besides an increment in the efficiency. In the electricity sector, Chile wants to reduce GHG emission by phasing-out mineral coal, shifting to thermal and solar electrification (Chile NDC, 2020).
According to CAT this updated NDC still is insufficient to comply with Paris Agreement goals. However, this NDC is stronger than the previous, establishing 95 MtCO2e in 2030 as a wider goal, having the peak of emissions in 2025 followed by a downward trend until net-zero in 2050 and a smaller emission budget until 2030. Also, Chile establishes a target in the forestry sector.
While analysing the conditional target of up to 45% GHG emission reductions by 2030 from 2016 levels, CAT concludes that is a bolder target. However, there are no details in the NDC for a complete assessment (Carbon Action Tracker, 2021).

The target status of Ukraine’s energy sector, at which the Strategy is aimed, is determined based on the need to:
• meet the population’s demand in both normal and emergency conditions;
• ensure the technically reliable and safe operation of the power supply system;
• provide for the economic efficiency of Ukrainian power supply systems and the energy sector in general;
• ensure the efficient energy use by the population and the national economy;
• find an environmentally sound solution to the environmental and climate impact of the energy sector;
• enable the state to form and implement policies aimed at protecting national interests regardless of the existing and potential internal and external threats to the energy sector.
The quantitative and qualitative targets of the Strategy are defined with due account of the need to ensure the sustainable development of the Ukrainian society in the long term, national economic priorities, and international obligations of Ukraine. The major targets for the period through 2035 are:
• to reduce GDP energy intensity by 2035 to the level of 0.17 koe per 1 USD Ukrainian GDP (PPP) and to bring this indicator nearer to that of the countries with similar climatic, geographic, and economic conditions;
• to optimize the structure of the country’s energy balance basing on energy security requirements and to bring the share of renewable energy to 20%;
• to achieve by 2020 the level of dependence on energy supplies from a single country (company) not exceeding 30% of total imports (for nuclear fuel, targets are set separately);
• to achieve by 2035 the level of dependence on supplies from a single country not exceeding 30% of the total consumption of all types of energy;
• to ensure a guaranteed compliance of generating capacities to the volumes and modes of energy consumption in the United Power System of Ukraine, particularly with regard to regulatory capacities availability;
• to ensure by 2025 the technical integration of Ukrainian and European electricity and gas markets (cross-border transmission networks) amounting to at least 15% of Ukraine’s domestic market volume;
• to form by 2035 a system of guaranteed power supplies to meet the demand of the national economy and the population during an emergency period equivalent to 90 days of consumption.

- No more conventionally-fuelled cars in cities.
- 40% use of sustainable low carbon fuels in aviation; at least 40% cut in shipping emissions.
- A 50% shift of medium distance intercity passenger and freight journeys from road to rail and waterborne transport.

""It aims to reduce water pollution from nitrates used for agricultural purposes and to prevent any further pollution. It is closely linked to other EU policies which address air and water quality, climate change and agriculture.
EU countries must:
- designate as vulnerable zones all those draining into waters which are or could be affected by high nitrate levels and eutrophication. The designation is reviewed and possibly revised at least every 4 years to take account of any changes that occur;
- establish mandatory action programmes for these areas, taking into account available scientific and technical data and overall environmental conditions;
- monitor the effectiveness of the action programmes;
- test the nitrate concentration in fresh ground and surface water at sampling stations, at least monthly and more frequently during flooding;
- carry out a comprehensive monitoring programme and submit every 4 years, a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Directive. The report includes information on nitrate-vulnerable zones, results of water monitoring, and a summary of the relevant - aspects of codes of good agricultural practices and action programmes;
- draw up a code of good agricultural practice which farmers apply on a voluntary basis. It sets out various good practices, such as when fertiliser use is inappropriate;

In 2000, it was revised and a new price at which a utility or supplier has to purchase renewable electricity from private generators was fixed. It ranges from € 0.03/kWh (for secondary biomass) to € 0.39/kWh (for PV under 5 kW). From 1999, wind electricity producers could receive either a fixed tariff of € 0.06/kWh or the average hourly market price of electricity plus a bonus of € 0.03/kWh. Rates are specified for both capacity and output credits. Output credits are the highest for wind and solar plants: € 0.07/kWh over a five-year period. Capacity credits are the highest for waste incineration plants; output credits for these plants vary depending on the size of the plant and on the relative importance of any co-fired fossil fuel. They also decrease annually. Buy-back rates for these plants are about € 0.06/kWh in the first year. Buy-back rates also depend on continuity of supply to avoid surges in power sold to the grid.

To United States proposes a shift to low carbon economy and scale up offshore renewable energy. In the electricity sector, United States aims to shift towards carbon-free electricity by 2035, increase energy efficiency, scale up distinct energy sources as hydrogen and invest in carbon capture. In the transport sector the kernel is to switch petrol fuelled vehicles to zero emission ones. Also, raise efficiency standards and investments in both low carbon fuels and alternative transport modals (e.g. rail and biking). In the building sector the focuses are on the enhancement of energy efficiency of electric heating and cooking devices, for instance investing in heat pumps and induction stoves. In the industry sector the government plans to shift fuel burning processes to very low- or zero-carbon processes and to invest in carbon capture. Agriculture and land use are also target by reforestation plans, rotational grazing and forest protection to avoid wildfires.
According to Climate Action Tracker, this target would translate into 1.5-2.5 GtCO2e/yr lower emissions in 2030 below the current policies trajectory. CAT points out that this target includes LULUCF and excluding it would translate to a 43-50% reduction below 2005 levels (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).

This strategy has established targets in the five thematic sectors to be accomplished within a five-year timeline up to 2025.
The Household Sector has two targets. It aims to increase the number of household appliances subjected to Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) from six to ten. It also aims for the use of improved efficient biomass cookstoves at 50 per cent of all households currently using biomass cookstoves.
There are six targets to be met in the Building Sector. First, there should be 10% share of newly built floor area compliant with energy efficiency requirements in the total building stock from the current baseline of zero. Second, two per cent of the buildings should have adopted American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standards for energy efficiency of buildings, or equivalent. Third, energy loads due to lighting in public buildings will be reduced by 50 per cent. Fourth and fifth, 20 per cent of public buildings and 25 per cent of the affordable houses the government is planning to build should be green, respectively. Lastly, the sector should develop Minimum Energy Performance Standards (MEPS) for buildings.
This strategy has also set two targets for the Industry and Agriculture Sector. The sector is expected to increase the number of energy audits carried out from the current 1,800 to 4,000. The sector is also expected to implement the recommended energy conservation measures to save 100 MW of power demand, 250 million litres of heavy fuel oil and 9 million litres of industrial diesel oil.
In the Transport Sector, three targets have been set. The first is the improvement of fuel economy. Increasing the share of electric vehicles in the transport sector has been identified as the second target, aiming to reach five per cent. Lastly, NEECS targets to increase the number of passengers using commuter trains from 116,000 to 150,000 per day.
In the Utilities Sector, the strategy identifies the need to reduce transmission and distribution system losses from 23 to 15 per cent.",https://unepdtu.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kenya-national-energy-efficiency-and-conservation-strategy-2020.pdf

he Climate Settlement is officially known as “Recommendation of the Energy and Environment Committee: Climate Settlement, Innst. 390 S (2011-2012), based on the White Paper on Climate Efforts, Meld. St. 21 (2011-2012)”. This document reinforces the targets set out in the 2008 agreement on climate policy on transportation; construction; agriculture and carbon uptake by forests; and mainland industry and petroleum activities. Some of the core measures the document recommends to be adopted within these areas include:
• Create a climate and energy fund for development of technology and industrial transformation;
• Increase the offshore supply of electric power from the mainland, while safeguarding biological diversity;
• Increase state subsidies for investment in, and operation of, municipal public transportation and other environmentally-friendly forms of transportation;
• Adopt climate measures in agriculture and carbon removals in forests through active forest management;
• Maintain or increase the forest carbon stock through active, sustainable forest policies;
• Improve incentives for the use of bio-energy derived from wood (with emphasis on forest residues);
• Increase the mandatory sale of bio-fuels to 5%;
• Tighten the energy requirements in the building code to passive house level in 2015 and nearly zero energy level in 2020.
The settlement includes three main targets:
• In relation to the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, Norway plans to exceed its commitment by 10%
• Norway plans to become carbon neutral by 2050. However, if an ambitious global climate agreement is entered into through which other industrialised countries commit to undertake large reductions in GHG emissions, Norway will bring forward this target to 2030
• By 2020 Norway plans to commit to reducing its GHG emissions to an equivalent of 30% of the 1990 emissions level (and up to 40% contingent on global action)
While emissions reductions can be carried out in Norway or abroad, the paper states that Norway will have a domestic reduction goal of two-thirds of GHG emissions.",http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/climate-settlement-innst-390-s-2011-2012/

1. Effective global environmental countermeasures in the power industry
Since effective actions consistent with national plans and targets, are needed in the power sector, promote the development of a sector-wide framework in which;
?The goals are consistent with national plans
?Main business operators including non-regional electric utilities are participating
?Responsible body is clearly defined (focusing on retail stage)
2. Treatment of CO2 within environmental assessment
Evaluate from a stand point below where necessary and reasonable
(a) Adoption of BATs (Best Available Technologies)
?The government will identify and publish “Development and commercialization status of cutting-edge power generation technologies” by size and by fuel types, as s reference for business operators’ consideration and will request business operators to adopt BATs
(b) Consistency with national targets and plans
b-1: In relation to mid-term target?If the business operator takes actions under the sector-wide framework or plans to take measures including mitigation in abroad to offset the net increase emission over a natural gas power plant, it is judged as consistent with national targets and plans.
b-2: In relation to 2050 target?The government will accelerate development of the technologies which is targeted to be commercialized by around 2020, conduct survey on potential CO2 storage sites as a prerequisite for CCS, identify requirements for CCS Ready plants, and request business operators to study continuously including technological development in order to put carbon capture facilities towards commercialization.

211000162,Alberta Electrcity Initiatives Canada (2015),Canada,"Direct investment, Procurement rules",Electricity and heat,"On November 22, 2015, Alberta announced its climate leadership plan. The plan states that:
• Alberta will phase out all coal-fired electricity generation in the province by 2030.
• Approximately 1/3 of this capacity will be replaced with natural gas, and 2/3 with renewables (up to 30% of Alberta’s total production).
• In the interim, Alberta will impose a carbon tax of $20 a tonne in 2017, $30 a tonne in 2018, and increasing in real terms after that. For the electricity sector, this will apply to coal-fired emissions above what Alberta’s cleanest natural gas-fired plan would emit for the same amount of electricity production.
In November, 2016, the Government of Alberta announced the first competition for new renewable energy development will begin in early 2017 with the successful bidders awarded at the end of 2017. It will be for up to 400 MW of renewable energy. The Government of Alberta also announced major changes to the electricity system. This includes:
• An electricity price ceiling of 6.8 cents/KWh from June 2017 until June 2021
• Partial re-regulation of the Alberta energy market (details TBA)
• Introduction of a capacity market (paired with the existing generation market), to encourage development of renewable generation. The market will be in place by 2021.
• Plan to introduce Bill 34, the Electric Utilities Amendment Act, would allow the Balancing Pool to borrow money from the province to manage its funding obligations. This change, in conjunction with Ministerial Orders that allow the Balancing Pool to smooth price volatility over a longer period of time, would support electricity costs remaining low and stable.",https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2024/a-surge-of-initiatives-developments-in-alberta-power-and-electricity-policy-to-watch-in-2024

For that, Cuba chose to use a variable reference year according to the action posited, ranging from 2014 (e.g. electricity generation based on Renewables) to 2020 (decrease of GHG in swine industry).
Some tasks are underscored, such as the urban planning, reforestation, increase the perception of population and mitigation/adaptation in core sectors.
The Specific Objective 11 and 15 are both related with mitigation practices, the former focusing on to increase energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources and the latter to Implement economic incentives (taxes, tariffs, credits and others) to achieve financial sustainability in the use and preservation of natural and environmental resources (Cuba NDC, 2020).
The plan encompasses all sectors (general) and touches upon all the mitigation areas analysed. A Climate Finance strategy, energy efficiency, urban planning and direct investments are measures that overarch all sectors aiming a reduction of carbon emissions. In the electricity sector, specifically, the focus is on augmenting the share of renewables and in the building in set standards, relying on solar panels both in residential and industrial areas. The novelty in this document when compared with the 2016 NDC is the inclusion of contributions on transportation, inciting a switch to less intensive or electric cars and forestry (Cuba NDC, 2020).
Cuba aims to increase 24% the energy generation with renewables by 2030 supported by direct investments from the government. Also, Cuba posits to increase energy efficiency, diminishing the use of fossil fuel in buildings and transportation by installation of solar heaters, LED lamps, induction cookers and fuel switch to a less intensive and e-mobile.
In the agriculture and forestry sector, the country posits reforestation as the main action. The commitment is to have 33% of the country covered with forest by 2030.

• Law on Hydrocarbons (seeks to attract foreign investment to Mexico’s hydrocarbon sector, but also eliminates gasoline subsidies and promotes substitution of oil energy sources by natural gas by establishing lower tax rates for shale gas exploitation; in addition it provides for creation of ‘safeguarded areas’ where hydrocarbon extraction is prohibited)
• Law on the Electricity industry (increase share of renewable electricity, clean energy certification, planning for a smart grid)
• Law on Coordinated Regulatory Organs for the energy matters
• Law on Petróleos Mexicanos (reforms the structure and obligations of the state oil company PEMEX)
• Law on the Federal Electricity Commission
• Law on the Agency for National Industry Security and Environment Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (industry operations security and control of hazardous emissions)
• Law on Geothermal Energy (regulates the exploration and exploitation of geothermal energy production for electricity generation and other uses)
• Law on Revenues from Hydrocarbons
• Law on the Mexican Petrol Fund for Stability and Development (revenues from petrol extraction in Mexico, of which at least 40% annually are reserved for long-term savings “for the future generations”, while the rest can be used for investment projects not limited to clean technologies – e.g. oil development projects included)"" (Source: http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/energy-reform-package/)

For CO2, CH4 and N2O the reference year is 1990 and for F-gases the reference year is 1995. In the reference year its emissions were 102.74 KtCO2e (excluding LULUCF) which has been decreasing during the 2000s, reaching 86,93 KtCO2e in 2018. There is no agriculture sector in the country. Monaco has set the goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050. For this, Monaco is setting efforts embedded in a national policy framework.
In the electricity sector, the goal is to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, so Monaco is trying to improve energy efficiency and decarbonise energy, investing in solar thermal and PV and geothermal networks. In buildings, also, the replacement of fossil fuels to biofuels is being incentivised, as well as, increasing environmental performance and energy efficiency of the buildings using sustainable codes and methods of construction and financial mechanisms for renovations. In the transport sector, Monaco focuses on the reduction of traffic and decarbonisation of the transport. A shift to other modals and public transportation is supported though electric public transportation. Lastly, the industry sector is weak in Monaco being mainly related to craft and cross sectoral measures about electricity will also cover this sector.
Market mechanisms under the article 6 is a possible outlined in the NDC to be used in the future to achieve the outlined reductions of GHG emissions (Monaco NDC, 2020).

On biogas. There is now a national biogas portal. It is written as follows: ""In order to strengthen this security of supply of natural gas, it identifies the support measures necessary to accelerate and develop projects for the production of biogas and any other form of gas renewable sources, in particular those from agricultural methanisation, while ensuring that there is no conflict of use with land and agricultural prices.""
On louminous advertising. Any illuminated advertising, any advertising supporting posters illuminated by projection or transparency, or any digital advertising in built-up areas and outside of built-up areas, on roads open to public traffic, as well as in a sensitive installation or work, may be prohibited by the Minister responsible for energy in the event that the security of the electricity supply is threatened without jeopardizing the goals of public security and national defense, as well as the safety of sensitive installations and works. When they are visible from a public roadway, ads placed inside of a building are likewise covered by this article. An item that sought to legalize the use of leftover cooking oil as fuel for private cars has been contested by the Constitutional Council.
On August 12, 2022, the Constitutional Council approved the law. The installation of a floating LNG carrier is prohibited by the Environmental Charter and is likely to harm the environment, according to the Council's decision. However, the Council approves this installation in light of the nation's independence being threatened by a challenging gas supply. The Constitutional Council's ruling is accompanied by an interpretational reservation in this context. This reservation states that the protection of the environment must be pursued in the same manner as the other core national interests.",https://app.climatepolicyradar.org/document/law-on-purchasing-power_cc5e?l=france&o=0

The SDE++ is a subsidy program that focuses on CO2 sequestration and low carbon electricity technology. Only businesses, organizations, and non-profits may apply to the program.
There are five main categories for this scheme: 
1. Renewable electricity (Hydropower, wind, solar...)
2. Renewable heat (solar thermal, geothermal, biomass combustion…)
3. Renewable gas (biomass fermentation or gasification)
4. Low CO2 heat (electric boiler, industrial heat pump…)
5. Low CO2 production (CCUS, hydrogen…)
Depending on the technology, the award may be disbursed over a period of up to 12 to 15 years. The amount of money given out is calculated based on how much energy the company generates or how many emissions are prevented thanks to the technology.
5 billion euros in grants were made available under this initiative in 2020 and 2021.
With an expenditure of EUR 2.1 billion, the CCUS project at the Port of Amsterdam will help sequester 2.5 million tons of CO2 annually in the 2020 round. 2 billion euros were given to solar and wind energy projects, with the remaining funds going toward industrial energy efficiency.",https://www.iea.org/policies/13639-stimulation-of-sustainable-energy-production-and-climate-transition-sde

The government will add the following tax rates corresponding to the amount of CO2 emission on the petroleum and coal tax on fossil fuel. Added tax rate:
- crude oil, petroleum products: JPY 760/kl (at present: JPY 2,040/kl)
- gaseous hydrocarbons: JPY 780/t (at present: JPY 1,080/t)
- coal: JPY 670/t (at present: JPY 700/t)
These tax rates will be in force on October 1, 2012. Necessary interim measures will be
taken until March 31, FY2016.
- standard tax rates will be applied from May 1, 2012 to such vehicles that satisfy certain conditions relating to environmental performance such as fuel consumption at the time of the supply of motor vehicle inspection certificates. These conditions could be changed depending on the shift of environmental standards (FY2015 environmental standards are now applicable.) Also, provisional tax rate applied to other vehicles will be reduced with the exception of vehicles used for more than 13 years.
- taking into account the view of promotion of global warming countermeasures and maintenance and promotion of technical superiority in automotive industry, the government will change environmental standards of “eco-car tax cut”, and extend automobile tonnage tax for three years by April 2015, extending reduction measures for vehicles with high environmental performance.",https://climate-laws.org/document/act-partially-amending-the-law-on-special-tax-measures-tax-reform-act-2012-law-no-16-of-2012_d4a5

The targets set for 2030 are as follows:
- Double the energy self-sufficiency ratio (18% at present, including nuclear power generation) and the domestically-developed fossil fuel supply ratio* (26% at present), and raise the energy independence ratio to about 70 percent from the present 38 percent.
*The ratio of fossil fuel supply from domestic and overseas interests that a Japanese company has a share in the total supply
- Raise the ratio of energy from zero-emission power sources such as nuclear and renewable energy to 70 percent (by more than 50% in 2020) from the present 34%. For this purpose:
Build more than 14 additional nuclear plants (nine by 2020).
Raise the overall plant capacity utilization rate to 90 percent (85% by 2020) from the 60% in 2008.
Maximize the use of renewable energy.
Cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the residential sector by half.
Maintain and raise energy efficiency in the industrial sector to the highest level in the world.
Maintain or achieve top-level shares of global markets for energy-related products and systems.
According to the plan, the goal is to reduce domestic energy-related CO2 emissions by 30 percent in 2030 compared to the 1990 level. Its intention was to increase nuclear energy in the mix to raise Japan's level of energy self-sufficiency, on the assumption this would also enhance energy security. (Although Japan imports all the uranium it needs for nuclear power generation, nuclear power was deemed a ""quasi-domestic energy"" because the government considers it possible to recycle nuclear fuel at home, if the nuclear fuel cycle is based on reprocessing used fuel and using it in fast-breeder reactors.)

It is based in a BAU scenario taking into account 2010 as base year.
Senegal posits its mitigation by establishing 2025 as middle point and 2030 as the end point. The numbers are as follow: (i) In the reference year, a projection of emissions to 2025 (32648,6097 GgCO2eq) and 2030 (37761,1405 GgCO2eq) were foreseen; (ii) In the unconditional scenario, Senegal proposes reductions of 5% (30987 GgCO2eq) and 7% (35106 GgCO2eq) respectivaly to 2025 and 2030 emissions; (iii) In the conditional scenario, the goals are bolder, reaching 23,78% (24883,0564 GgCO2eq) in 2025 and 25,53% (26611,0057 GgCO2eq) in 2030.
The main policy instrument to be set is the carbon market and the main sector to be tackled is the electricity and power, shifting to renewables and for less intensive fuel (e.g. from oil to natural gas) (Senegal NDC, 2020).
The country aims to go an extra mile with international aid mainly in the electricity sector, outlining an unconditional achievement of a cumulative installed solar capacity of 235 MW, 150MW in wind power, 314 MW in hydroelectricity in 2030 and presents a conditional one of an additional solar capacity of 100 MW, 100 MW in wind power, 50 MW of biomass, 50 MW of CSP, by 2030. Moreover, Senegal has a wider goal to reach 999 MW in renewable energies (conditionally) and invest to switch carbon intensive fuels to natural gas in dual thermal power stations (fuel oil / gas), which will bring the total installed 600 MW of natural gas between 2025 and 2030.

The plan calls for an “experimental phase” over the next five years to gradually provide access to areas of the roughly 700,000 square kilometres of available forest through community management permits and to test different approaches to community forestry through a number of officially recognised pilot projects.
The implementation of the National Strategy should be ensured on four axes:
1. the establishment of a steering committee (national and provincial);
2. the regular convening of the Roundtable on Community Forestry (at both national and provincial levels) to intensify the dialogue between stakeholders involved;
3. establishing a database of local community forest concessions;
4. ongoing monitoring of these concessions to assess the impact on forest protection, as well as drivers of deforestation and degradation.

The Plan’s objective is to prepare the country’s industry for the new future scenario that is emerging in the horizon, in which carbon productivity, equivalent to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions per product unit, will be as important as work productivity and other productive factors in defining the international competitiveness of Brazilian industry. In order to do that, it will be necessary to establish management systems for the greenhouse gas emission of the industrial sector as tools to improve competitiveness, in a process similar to the implementation of environmental management systems in the past.
“The design and implementation of the sector plan is based on the rules established by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and do not affect the ongoing validity of such rules, including the commitment with international financial and technological support for the actions of countries not included in Annex and flexibilities for them with regard to measurement, communication and verification of emissions and emission reductions.
“The Industry Plan is based on three pillars:
(i) Gradual implementation of a measurement, reporting and verification system (MRV) for the emission of greenhouse gases produced by industrial activities.
(ii) Action Plan with a set of measures and instruments to encourage emission reductions.
(iii) Creation of an Industry Plan Technical Commission (CTPIn) comprising representatives of the government, industry, civil society and academia, responsible for detailing the Plan’s actions, monitoring and periodical reviews.
“The Industry Plan adopts as reference a 5% reduction target for emissions in industrial processes and energy use in the industrial sector, in relation to the trend scenario (Business As Usual) projected for 2020. The target’s role is to stimulate improvements to the efficiency of industrial processes and not to hinder economic growth.”

211005186,Nationally Determined Contribution - NDC European Union (2020),European Union,"Climate strategy, Political & non-binding climate strategy, GHG reduction target, Political & non-binding GHG reduction target",General,"The EU’s NDC establishes the target of reducing at least 55% of its emissions by 2030 compared to 1990. It is an economy-wide and absolute pledge, covering all sectors and gases (EU NDC, 2020).
The overarching measures in force in EU are three-folded: Emissions reduction targets under current EU legislation are divided between the sectors covered by the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), which is put a price in the carbon and established a cap for emission allowances; by the non-ETS sectors under the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR), which individual binding targets for Member States is set considering emissions not covered by the EU ETS; and land-use related emissions and removals addressed by the regulation on emissions and removals from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).
Additionally, the EU passed regulations to improve energy efficiency (improve at least 32.5% by 2030), for increasing renewable energy in final energy consumption (at least 32% by 2030) and reduce CO2 emissions in the road transport sector, increasing performance (reducing emissions) of cars and lorries.
The EU agreed to reduce at least 55% GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030. Though this is a stronger target, it is not enough to reach 1.5°C, and a proposal between 58% and 70% is needed (European Parliament proposed 60%). Also due to methodological complexities caused by Brexit, CAT cannot rate this NDC. Nevertheless, CAT points out that the reduction would have to be between 2,324 – 2,329 MtCO2e or 52.8% (Climate Action Tracker, 2021).
CAT suggests more ambitious policy measures, which would lead to significant reductions. For instance, revise the Renewable Energy Directive based on new proposals from the ‘Fit for 55%’ package, and decrease the emissions cap of the EU-ETS, steering a coal phase-out and better performance for cars and the increase in the share of electrical vehicles.
